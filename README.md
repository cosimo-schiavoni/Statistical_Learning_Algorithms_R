# Statistical Learning Project: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning (01/2025)

This project presents an in-depth examination of the economic development of 147 countries using cross-sectional data from 2021. The study is structured into two main parts.
1. The first part applies supervised learning algorithms such as Multiple Linear Regression, Generalized Additive Models, Random Forest, Ridge and Lasso Regression
to analyze the relationship between GDP per capita, a measure of economic development, and several independent variables (including Corruption Control, Foreign Direct Investment, Political Stability, and the Democratic Index). The objective
is to identify the factors that most significantly influence economic development across the dataset.
2. The second part of the study adopts unsupervised learning techniques, focusing on clustering.

In the Repository it is possible to find:
- The R code used for the analysis of each algorithm
- The pdf document with the content of the project
